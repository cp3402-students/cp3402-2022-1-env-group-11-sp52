# Deployment
## Developing Instructions
To develop our site comprehensively, we used multiple websites to help us create and manage the whole site. The site developing part would be held on the staging site, and after checking all of the editions, the changes would be applied to the production site. To help all of the developers understand the developing progress well, this instruction would mention the websites we used and give a clear developing guide.
