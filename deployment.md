# Deployment
## Developing Instructions
To develop our site comprehensively, we used multiple websites to create and manage the whole site. The site developing part would be held on the staging site, and after checking and testing all of the editions, the changes would be applied to the production site. To help all of the developers understand the developing progress well, this instruction would mention the websites we used and give a clear developing guide. 
## Developing Tools
### Site Development
**WordPress:** WordPress is a popular website developing tools which is usually used around the world. The users are allowed to edit their sites easily without downloading any applications and any coding knowledge. With the useful features in WordPress, the sites could be presented with attractive appearances. WordPress can be accessed here: https://wordpress.com/
### Developing Management
**Discord:** Discord is an application that allows users to build a server to contact other users with texts and voice. In our project, Discord is adopted as the main contacting platform that group members could ask questions and track the developing progresses immediately. Discord could be downloaded here: https://discord.com/

**GitHub:** GitHub is a great developing tool that allows a team to take version control for their project. For example, while a group of people are working on a program, they have to push and pull the files frequently. All of the members could easily know how the program is progressing by reading the commits. GitHub could be accessed here: https://github.com/

**Trello:** Trello is a tasks progress control tool that allows a group of developers to distribute the tasks and track the progress. For example, the leader of a group could assign a member to a task, and this member has to mark this task as done when finished. It would help a lot and prevent members from doing the same tasks.
