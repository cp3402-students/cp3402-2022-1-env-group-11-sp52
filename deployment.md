# Deployment

To develop our site comprehensively, we used multiple websites to create and manage the whole site. The site development part would be held on the staging site, and after checking and testing all of the editions, the changes would be applied to the production site. To help all the developers understand the development process well, this instruction will mention the websites we used and give a clear development guide.

## Development Tools

### Site Development

**WordPress:** WordPress is a popular website development tool which is widely used around the world. The users are allowed to edit their sites easily without downloading any applications and any coding knowledge. With the useful features in WordPress, the sites could be presented with attractive appearances. WordPress can be accessed here: <https://wordpress.com/>

### Project Management

**Discord:** Discord is an application that allows users to create a server to contact other users with texts and voice. In our project, Discord is adopted as the main contacting platform on which group members could ask questions and track the development progress immediately. Discord could be downloaded here: <https://discord.com/>

**GitHub:** GitHub is a great development tool that allows a team to use version control for their project. For example, while a group of people are working on a program, they have to push and pull the files frequently. All of the members could easily know how the program is progressing by reading the commits. GitHub could be accessed here: <https://github.com/>

**Trello:** Trello is a project management tool that allows a group of developers to distribute the tasks and track the progress. For example, the leader of a group could assign a member to a task, and this member has to mark this task as done when finished. It would help a lot and prevent members from doing the same tasks. Trello could be accessed here: <https://trello.com/>

### Site Hosting

**Pantheon:** After finishing the part of site building, the last step to do is to host our site. Pantheon is a website hosting service which could be used with WordPress. With the hosting service, our sites could be seen by the people all around the world, instead of just the local environment. Pantheon could be accessed here: <https://pantheon.io/>

## Development Environment

### Local Environment

In our project, most of the tasks are done in WordPress. All of the members would receive a personal account that could enter the backstage of our sites. After finishing the assigned part on the Staging site, we would report our progress on the discord. After the leader checked and tested the edited part, we would export our site and push it to our github repository to do a version control.

### Hosted Environment

The tested pages could be used to the Production sites with WordPress. By the help of WordPress the new developers could easily clone the old page to ensure all of the setting are follow the original pages.

**Staging Site:** <https://dev-baizonn-learning-center.pantheonsite.io/>
The “dev” in the url shows that this website is created for development and testing. All of the changes should be tested on this website first before they are applied for the Production site.

**Production Site:** <https://live-baizonn-learning-center.pantheonsite.io/>
