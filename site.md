# Site Development Overview

## Site Overview

To allow for ease of future modification of this Wordpress site, the following overview will attempt to outline the site's layout, logic, widgets, and other features. The site itself is composed of pages and posts, each allowing for different kinds of customisation. The following main sections (PAGES) and their subsequent posts and features are listed here:

## Pages

1. **HOME:** The home page is the website's landing page, and it is where new visitors will come by default. The present home page includes a welcome message column and image that are inserted as a block text/image combination, and the button within this block is linked to the Registration page and can be relinked as needed using the WordPress editor. The image was taken from Unsplash, which is mentioned in a2.html, and where it can be modified. The Elementor plugin, which gives the site unique features and appearance, is present on the home page, as it is on the majority of other pages.

2. **ABOUT US:** The About Us page of the website is an essential source of information for all who want to know more about the Baizonn Learning Center. All of the content on this page is organized into a single vertical column and is presented in a single-page layout. It’s a simple, straightforward design. When using the single-column layout for a text-heavy page, remember to break up the text every so often with imagery, line breaks, headers, or sub-headers.

3. **FACULTY:** The faculty page is quite straightforward; it has a page layout with the faculty member's description and a call-to-action button that directs users to the Registration page.

4. **DISCOUNT:** The Discount page includes the Baizonn Learning Center's promotions, a description, and a call-to-action button that takes viewers to the Registration page.

5. **SCHEDULE:** The academic calendar and schedule description are found on the schedule page. A call to action button within this block is linked to the registration page and can be changed as necessary using the WordPress editor.

6. **CONTACT US:** The contact page includes all the standard information — name, location, email, and so forth. These can be edited directly from WordPress. The map image links to Google Maps.

## SubPages

1. **LEARNING ENVIRONMENT:** The learning environment page, a sub-page of the About Us web page, offers further details about the Baizonn Learning Center. It can be edited using the WordPress editor or Elementor plugin.

2. **STUDENT EXPERIENCE:** The student experience page is a component of the About Us website that features recent learning center-related news and a call to action button in the footer. It can be modified using the WordPress editor or the Elementor plugin.

3. **CLASSES:** Additional courses are available on the Classes page, a subpage of the About Us page, which also has a call to action button in the footer. Either the Elementor plugin or the WordPress editor can be used to edit it.

4. **REGISTRATION:** The Registration/sign-up page is a subpage of the Contact Us page, however, it can be moved to the main menu if necessary. It has a registration form that was developed using the "Fluent forms" plugin. Users can fill up this form, and an email will then be sent to the specified inbox after submission.

## Plugins

WordPress uses Plugins to gain additional functionality, features, and tools that are not theme-specific, meaning you could use the same theme and end up with entirely different sites in terms of function and potential. It is important to note that much of the functionality and plugins can be found in the sidebar widget area. For this site, we took advantage of a number of useful plugins to enhance the site. Each plugin, its use, and any useful details can be found below:
