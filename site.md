# Site Development Overview

## Site Overview

To allow for ease of future modification of this Wordpress site, the following overview will attempt to outline the site's layout, logic, widgets, and other features. The site itself is composed of pages and posts, each allowing for different kinds of customisation. The following main sections (PAGES) and their subsequent posts and features are listed here:

## Pages

1. **HOME:** The home page is the website's landing page, and it is where new visitors will come by default. The present home page includes a welcome message column and image that are inserted as a block text/image combination, and the button within this block is linked to the Registration page and can be relinked as needed using the WordPress editor. The image was taken from Unsplash, which is mentioned in a2.html, and where it can be modified. The Elementor plugin, which gives the site unique features and appearance, is present on the home page, as it is on the majority of other pages.

2. **ABOUT US:** The About Us page of the website is an essential source of information for all who want to know more about the Baizonn Learning Center. All of the content on this page is organized into a single vertical column and is presented in a single-page layout. It’s a simple, straightforward design. When using the single-column layout for a text-heavy page, remember to break up the text every so often with imagery, line breaks, headers, or sub-headers.

3. **FACULTY:** The faculty page is quite straightforward; it has a page layout with the faculty member's description and a call-to-action button that directs users to the Registration page.

4. **DISCOUNT:** The Discount page includes the Baizonn Learning Center's promotions, a description, and a call-to-action button that takes viewers to the Registration page.

5. **SCHEDULE:** The academic calendar and schedule description are found on the schedule page. A call to action button within this block is linked to the registration page and can be changed as necessary using the WordPress editor.

6. **CONTACT US:** The contact page includes all the standard information — name, location, email, and so forth. These can be edited directly from WordPress. The map image links to Google Maps.
